# EICL - Efficiency Is Clever Laziness
EICL is a lightweight, no-nonsense benchmarking tool crafted for engineers who value speed, simplicity, and clarity. It aims to make benchmarking not only efficient but almost lazy-level easy — with zero overhead, intuitive configuration, and versatile cross-language support. 

## Purpose
EICL was built with a simple goal: stop guessing, start measuring. Whether you're testing the throughput of your Go routines, the latency of your Triton kernel, or the performance quirks of C++/Haskell code, EICL provides a unified, elegant interface to benchmark like a boss.

## Tech Stack
1. GoLang — Core system + CLI interface
2. Triton — For GPU kernel benchmarking and performance profiling
3. Haskell — Coz why not

## Features
- Datta will build them.
